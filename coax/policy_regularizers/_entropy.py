class EntropyRegularizer(PolicyRegularizer):
    r"""

    Policy regularization term based on the entropy of the policy.

    The regularization term is to be added to the loss function:

    .. math::

        \text{loss}(\theta; s,a)\ =\
            -J(\theta; s,a) + \beta\,H[\pi_\theta(.|s)]

    where :math:`J(\theta)` is the bare policy objective.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pi : Policy

        The policy to be regularized.

    beta : non-negative float

        The coefficient that determines the strength of the overall regularization term.

        JIT-compiled function that returns the values for the regularization
        term.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dist_params : pytree with ndarray leaves

            The distribution parameters of the (conditional) probability distribution
            :math:`\pi(a|s)`.

        beta : non-negative float

            The coefficient that determines the strength of the overall regularization term.

        JIT-compiled function that returns the performance metrics for the regularization term.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dist_params : pytree with ndarray leaves
