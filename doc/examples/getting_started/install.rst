=======

Even though ``coax`` requires the ``jax``, it doesn't have an explicit dependence on it. The reason
is that your version of ``jax`` and ``jaxlib`` will depend on your CUDA version.

Please select the configuration that applies to your setup.

Alternatively, you may also choose build ``jaxlib`` from source by following
`this guide <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html#building-from-source>`_.
